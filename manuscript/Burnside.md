# Burnside's Lemma
> Given {$$}k{/$$} colors how many different ways are there to color the
> vertices of the cube?

In this chapter we will answer this question and many others with the aid of
_Burnside's Lemma_.

**Lemma _(Burnside)_**
> Let {$$}G{/$$} be a group acting on a set {$$}X{/$$}. The number of orbits of
> this action {$$}X/G{/$$} is equal to

{$$}
\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G} X^{g}
{/$$}

Here {$$}X^{g}{/$$} is defined as {$$}\{x \in X | x \cdot g = x\}{/$$}.
