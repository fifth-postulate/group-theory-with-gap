# Burnside's Lemma
> Given {$$}k{/$$} colors how many different ways are there to color the
> vertices of the cube?

In this chapter we will answer this question and many others with the aid of
_Burnside's Lemma_.

> **Lemma _(Burnside)_** Let {$$}G{/$$} be a group acting on a set {$$}X{/$$}.
> The number of orbits of this action {$$}X/G{/$$} is equal to
>
>{$$}
>\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G} X^{g}
>{/$$}
>
> Here {$$}X^{g}{/$$} is defined as {$$}\{x \in X | x \cdot g = x\}{/$$}.

## Exercises
1. Generalize necklaces to {$$}m{/$$} colors and {$$}n{/$$} beads and show that
   the rotation relation is an equivalence relation.
2. Check the table of counts of fixed necklaces.
