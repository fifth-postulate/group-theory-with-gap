# Action
> What can we do with a group?

In this chapter we are going to define what we mean by a _group action_. 

> *Definition* Let {$$}G{/$$} be a group and {$$}X{/$$} a set. A function
> {$$}\phi : X \times G \rightarrow X{/$$} is called an _action_ if the
> following rules apply for all {$$}x \in X{/$$} and {$$}g, h \in G{/$$} 
>
> 1. {$$}\phi(x, e) = x{/$$} where {$$}e{/$$} is the identity of {$$}G{/$$}.
> 2. {$$}\phi(x, gh) = \phi(\phi(x, g), h){/$$}.

If the action is clear from the context we will often use the following
shorthand in notation: we write {$$}x \cdot g{/$$} for {$$}\phi(x, g){/$$}.

## Exercises
1. Express the rules of an action in the shorthand notation.
