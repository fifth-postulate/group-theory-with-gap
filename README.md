# group-theory-with-gap
An introduction to group theory with emphasis on concrete calculations

## Goal
This repository contains material that will teach [group theory][wikipedia.group-theory]. The main goal is provide a very concrete understanding of group theory. We achieve this by using [GAP][gap], a computer algebra system. GAP is described as

> a system for computational discrete algebra, with particular emphasis on Computational Group Theory. GAP provides a programming language, a library of thousands of functions implementing algebraic algorithms written in the GAP language as well as large data libraries of algebraic objects.
