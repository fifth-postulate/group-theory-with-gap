# Group Theory with GAP
An introduction to group theory with emphasis on concrete calculations

## Goal
This repository contains material that will teach
[group theory][wikipedia.group-theory]. The main goal is provide a very concrete
understanding of group theory. We achieve this by using [GAP][gap], a computer
algebra system. GAP is described as 

> a system for computational discrete algebra, with particular emphasis on
> Computational Group Theory. GAP provides a programming language, a library of
> thousands of functions implementing algebraic algorithms written in the GAP
> language as well as large data libraries of algebraic objects. 

## Outline
Here we list the questions we want to answer and how we are answering them with
group theory.

### How many different kinds of colored cubes are there
If we have a cube, and a number of colors, how many different ways are there to
color the cube taking rotations in account?
